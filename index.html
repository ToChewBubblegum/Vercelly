<h1>Vercel Technical Assignment</h1>
<p>My name is Amo, and I’m excited about this opportunity to complete the technical assignment with Vercel!</p>
    
<h2>About Me</h2>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ToChewBubblegum/Vercelly/main/IMG_8501.jpg" alt="Popular llama at Crypto conference">
<p>I'm a Technical Customer Success Manager with experience managing enterprise accounts, driving adoption, and helping customers succeed with innovative solutions.</p>
<p>Currently, I work on a team handling enterprise contracts managing a large portfolio of accounts while ensuring customer retention and growth.</p>

<h2>What Excites Me About Customer Success</h2>
<p>What excites me most about this role is the blend of <strong>strategic problem-solving, relationship-building, and technical enablement</strong>. I enjoy understanding customer needs, aligning solutions, and driving value where possible. What makes it even more enjoyable is working with best-in-class products and solutions such as Vercel.</p>

<h2>Why Vercel?</h2>
<p>Vercel’s platform is <strong>developer-first, fast, and seamless</strong>, exactly what modern businesses need for web performance and scalability. I love how Vercel empowers teams to deploy effortlessly, and I’m eager to help customers get the most out of it!</p>
<p>Whether you’re a hobbyist working on a side project or a globally recognized brand like <strong>Adobe</strong>, Vercel adapts to your needs, making it a truly scalable and versatile solution. All managed from a single platform instead of having to piece together third party solutions which requires a lot of cost to just maintain, Vercel provides a very flexible approach to applications for the web.</p>

<h2>Interests</h2>
<p>Outside of work, I love learning, it’s almost a hobby in itself! I tend to dive deep into new interests, and some of the ones that have stuck with me include <strong>coffee, plants, aquariums, and crypto</strong>. I could talk about these for hours!</p>

<h2>Interesting or Fun Fact</h2>
<p>I once did a <strong>10-day silent retreat</strong>, completely disconnected from the outside world, practicing <strong>10 hours of daily meditation</strong> . It involved living the life of a monk for ten days, no phone, no talking, no socialising, and even no eye contact! Each day started at <strong>4:30 AM</strong>, with breaks only for food. The hardest and the most rewarding experience I have lived through</p>
